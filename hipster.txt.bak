Dark Souls III[a] is a 2016 action role-playing video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. It is the fourth overall entry of the Souls series and the final installment of the Dark Souls trilogy.

It is an action role-playing game played in a third-person perspective. Players have access to various weapons, armour, magic, and consumables that they can use to fight their enemies. Bonfires serve as checkpoints. The Estus Flask is the consumable used for healing in Dark Souls III. Ashen Estus Flasks restore focus points (FP), which can be used for magic or weapon arts. Hidetaka Miyazaki, the creator of the series, returned to direct the game after handing the development duties of Dark Souls II to others in FromSoftware

Dark Souls III was critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It was the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, shipping over three million copies within its first two months and over 10 million by 2020. Two downloadable content (DLC) expansions, Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City, were also made. A complete version containing the base game and both expansions, Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades, was released in April 2017.
